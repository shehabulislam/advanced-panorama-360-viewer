== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What image formats are supported? =

The plugin supports equirectangular images in common web formats such as JPG, PNG, and WebP. For best results, use high-quality equirectangular images with a 2:1 aspect ratio.

= Can I use this plugin with page builders other than Gutenberg? =

The plugin is designed to work seamlessly with the Gutenberg block editor. While it doesn't provide native support for other page builders, you can use the plugin's shortcode in any page builder that supports shortcodes. We're considering adding support for more page builders in future updates.

= How can I optimize the performance of 360-degree panoramas on my site? =

To ensure optimal performance, we recommend using compressed images, enabling browser caching, and using a content delivery network (CDN) for your website. The plugin is designed to load resources efficiently, but large panoramic images may still impact page load times.

= Can I customize the viewer controls? =

Yes, the Gutenberg block provides options to customize the viewer controls. You can choose to show or hide controls, and even specify custom control settings to tailor the user experience.

= Does this plugin support VR viewing? =

Currently, the plugin does not have built-in VR support. However, we're exploring the possibility of adding WebVR compatibility in a future release.
